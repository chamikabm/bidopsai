# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AgentCore Agentic System is a sophisticated multi-agent workflow orchestration platform that automates the bid/RFP response process through intelligent document processing, content generation, and compliance checking. The system uses AWS Bedrock AgentCore runtime with Strands Agents framework to coordinate 8 specialized agents in a supervised workflow pattern.

The system processes uploaded RFP documents through a complete workflow: parsing → analysis → content generation → compliance checking → quality assurance → communications → submission. Each step involves specialized agents with human-in-the-loop feedback capabilities and real-time streaming updates to the frontend.
