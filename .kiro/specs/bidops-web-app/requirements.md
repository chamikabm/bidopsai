# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a cutting-edge, futuristic web application called bidops.ai - an AI-powered bid automation platform. The application will feature a modern, sci-fi inspired interface that combines the polish of Vercel, precision of Linear, cyberpunk aesthetics, and Bloomberg Terminal sophistication. The platform enables users to create projects, upload documents, and leverage AI agents to automate the entire bid preparation process from document parsing to final submission.

The system integrates with AWS AgentCore for AI agent orchestration, uses AWS Cognito for authentication, GraphQL for API communication, and implements a complex workflow involving 8 specialized agents: Supervisor, Parser, Analysis, Content, Knowledge, Compliance, QA, Comms, and Submission agents.
