# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive GraphQL backend API for the BidOps.ai platform. The API will serve as the core data layer, providing secure, efficient access to all application data including projects, users, knowledge bases, artifacts, and workflow executions. The implementation will use modern TypeScript, Apollo Server, and follow GraphQL best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

9. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL support migration rollbacks and version control

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want real-time updates, so that users can see live changes to projects, workflows, and notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project data changes THEN the system SHALL publish subscription updates
2. WHEN workflow execution status changes THEN the system SHALL notify subscribed clients
3. WHEN notifications are created THEN the system SHALL push them to relevant users
4. WHEN artifacts are updated THEN the system SHALL broadcast changes to project members
5. WHEN subscription connections are established THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive project management capabilities, so that I can create, update, and track bid projects throughout their lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL validate input data and create all related records
2. WHEN updating project status THEN the system SHALL enforce valid state transitions
3. WHEN adding project members THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions and create associations
4. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL generate S3 presigned URLs securely
5. WHEN querying projects THEN the system SHALL filter results based on user access rights

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a knowledge base administrator, I want to manage organizational knowledge, so that teams can leverage past proposals and expertise in new bids.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating knowledge bases THEN the system SHALL support both global and project-specific scopes
2. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL integrate with AWS Bedrock vector stores
3. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access to knowledge bases
4. WHEN searching documents THEN the system SHALL provide efficient full-text and vector search
5. WHEN deleting knowledge bases THEN the system SHALL handle cascading deletions properly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow orchestrator, I want to track agent execution, so that I can monitor progress and handle failures in the bid automation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow executions are created THEN the system SHALL initialize all required agent tasks
2. WHEN agent tasks update THEN the system SHALL maintain execution state and progress tracking
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL update project status and notify stakeholders
5. WHEN querying workflow data THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want artifact management capabilities, so that I can create, version, and collaborate on bid documents and presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating artifacts THEN the system SHALL support multiple content types (documents, Q&A, spreadsheets)
2. WHEN updating content THEN the system SHALL maintain version history with proper attribution
3. WHEN approving artifacts THEN the system SHALL enforce approval workflows based on user roles
4. WHEN exporting artifacts THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate file formats for submission
5. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL track changes and provide conflict resolution

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want extensible integration support, so that the platform can connect with external tools like Slack, email systems, and submission portals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring integrations THEN the system SHALL validate connection parameters securely
2. WHEN integration events occur THEN the system SHALL log all activities for audit purposes
3. WHEN integrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN testing integrations THEN the system SHALL provide validation endpoints
5. WHEN managing configurations THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive credentials

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want robust database management with ORM capabilities, so that I can maintain data integrity and perform efficient operations across development and production environments.
