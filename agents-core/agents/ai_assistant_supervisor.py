"""
AI Assistant Supervisor Agent - Intent-Based AI Assistance

Provides intent-based routing for AI assistant queries.
Implements proper OOP design inheriting from BaseAgent.

Responsibilities:
- Understand user intent from natural language queries
- Route to appropriate specialized sub-agents
- Provide contextual assistance without workflow constraints
- Support ad-hoc document analysis and generation
- Answer questions about projects and artifacts

Mode: Fixed to "ai_assistant" for intent-based behavior

    AI Assistant Supervisor - Intent-Based AI Assistance.
    
    Provides flexible, intent-based AI assistance without the constraints
    of sequential workflow. Routes user queries to appropriate sub-agents
    based on detected intent using Intent Router pattern.
    
    Use Cases:
    - Ad-hoc document analysis ("Analyze this RFP")
    - Quick artifact generation ("Create an executive summary")
    - Project queries ("What's the status of Project X?")
    - Knowledge base searches ("Find past bids for healthcare")
    - Compliance checks ("Is this compliant with SOC2?")
    
    The supervisor autonomously:
    1. Analyzes user query to detect intent
    2. Routes to appropriate sub-agent(s):
       - Parser: Document processing requests
       - Analysis: RFP analysis queries
       - Content: Artifact generation requests
       - Knowledge: Historical data searches
       - Compliance: Compliance verification
       - QA: Quality assessment queries
    3. Aggregates multi-agent responses if needed
    4. Provides conversational, helpful responses
    
    Mode Behavior:
    - Mode is hardcoded to "ai_assistant" for intent routing
    - Uses Intent Router pattern (not StateGraph)
    - No workflow constraints - handles one-off requests
    - Stateless execution per query
    
    Example:
        ```python
        # Create AI assistant supervisor (Java-style)
        assistant = AIAssistantSupervisor()
        
        # Get Strands Agent and invoke
        agent = assistant.get_agent()
        result = await agent.ainvoke({
            "messages": [{
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Analyze the healthcare RFP document"
            }]
        })
        ```
