# Phase 6: Testing & Validation Plan

## Overview

The final phase of the refactor focuses on comprehensive testing and validation to ensure the Strands Agent architecture works correctly end-to-end.

## Objectives

1. ✅ Validate all refactored components work together
2. ✅ Test critical workflows end-to-end
3. ✅ Verify error handling and recovery
4. ✅ Validate SSE streaming
5. ✅ Test checkpoint resumption
6. ✅ Document any issues found
7. ✅ Create final refactor completion report

---

## Testing Strategy

### Level 1: Component Validation ✅

**Goal**: Verify individual components are correctly structured

**Areas to Validate**:
1. **Agent Factory Functions** - All 8 agents (supervisor + 7 sub-agents)
2. **Tool Registrations** - All tools properly registered
3. **Graph Structure** - All nodes and edges correctly defined
4. **State Models** - All state fields properly typed
5. **FastAPI Endpoints** - Request/response models correct

**Method**: Static code review and structure validation

---

### Level 2: Unit Testing (Future Work)

**Goal**: Test individual functions in isolation

**Priority Functions for Unit Tests**:
1. `_initialize_workflow_state()`
2. `_resume_workflow_state()`
3. `_analyze_feedback_intent()`
4. Graph routing functions (6 conditional functions)
5. Agent node functions (helper functions like `_invoke_agent_with_context()`)

**Method**: pytest with mocking

**Status**: ⚠️ Out of scope for this refactor - recommend as follow-up work

---

### Level 3: Integration Testing

**Goal**: Test workflows with actual components interacting

**Critical Test Scenarios**:

#### Test 1: New Workflow Initialization ✅
**Steps**:
1. Send POST /invocations with start=true
2. Verify workflow_execution_id created
3. Verify SSE events streamed
4. Verify DB records created
5. Verify checkpoint saved

**Expected Outcome**:
- WorkflowExecution record in DB
- AgentTask records created
- Graph executes initialize node
- Parser and Analysis nodes execute
- Await_analysis_feedback node pauses workflow
- Response has `awaiting_feedback=true`

#### Test 2: Workflow Resumption with Feedback ✅
**Steps**:
1. Start workflow (Test 1)
2. Wait for interruption at analysis feedback
3. Send POST /invocations with start=false, user_input.chat="proceed"
4. Verify checkpoint loaded
5. Verify feedback applied
6. Verify graph resumes
7. Verify content agent executes

**Expected Outcome**:
- Checkpoint loaded from MemorySaver
- State updated with feedback
- feedback_intent="proceed"
- Graph continues to content agent
- Content agent executes and creates artifacts

#### Test 3: Feedback Intent Routing ✅
**Scenarios**:
- **Reparse**: Feedback contains "reparse" → loops to parser
- **Reanalyze**: Feedback contains "reanalyze" → loops to analysis
- **Proceed**: Generic feedback → continues to content

**Expected Outcome**:
- Correct routing based on intent
- Tasks reset as needed
- Graph flows to correct node

#### Test 4: Compliance Loop ✅
**Steps**:
1. Execute through content agent
2. Compliance agent fails artifacts
3. Verify tasks reset (content, compliance)
4. Verify graph loops back to content
5. Content agent re-executes
6. Compliance agent passes
7. Graph proceeds to QA

**Expected Outcome**:
- Compliance failure triggers retry
- Content and Compliance tasks reset
- Loop executes correctly
- Eventually passes and proceeds

#### Test 5: QA Loop ✅
**Steps**:
1. Execute through compliance
2. QA agent fails artifacts
3. Verify tasks reset (content, compliance, qa)
4. Verify graph loops back to content
5. All three agents re-execute
6. QA agent passes
7. Graph proceeds to artifact review

**Expected Outcome**:
- QA failure triggers retry
- All three tasks reset
- Loop executes correctly
- Eventually passes and proceeds

#### Test 6: User Permission Nodes ✅
**Scenarios**:
- **Comms Permission**: User says "yes" → proceeds, "no" → skips
- **Submission Permission**: User says "yes" → proceeds, "no" → skips

**Expected Outcome**:
- Correct routing based on user response
- Appropriate agents executed or skipped
- Workflow completes correctly

#### Test 7: Error Handling ✅
**Scenarios**:
1. Invalid session_id → 400 error
2. Non-existent checkpoint → 404 error
3. Tool execution failure → agent task marked failed
4. Database connection error → 500 error

**Expected Outcome**:
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error messages clear and actionable
- SSE error events emitted
- Workflow state reflects error

#### Test 8: SSE Streaming ✅
**Steps**:
1. Connect to /stream/{session_id}
2. Start workflow
3. Verify events received in order:
   - connected
   - node_completed (for each node)
   - awaiting_feedback (at interruptions)
   - workflow_completed (at end)

**Expected Outcome**:
- All events received in correct order
- Event data includes progress, current_agent, timestamps
- No dropped events
- Connection maintained throughout

---

### Level 4: End-to-End Workflow Testing

**Goal**: Validate complete workflow from start to finish

#### E2E Test: Happy Path ✅

**Full Workflow Steps**:
1. ✅ Start workflow (POST /invocations, start=true)
2. ✅ Parser executes → processes documents
3. ✅ Analysis executes → generates analysis
4. ✅ Await feedback → workflow pauses
5. ✅ User provides "proceed" feedback
6. ✅ Content executes → creates artifacts
7. ✅ Compliance executes → passes
8. ✅ QA executes → passes
9. ✅ Await review → workflow pauses
10. ✅ User approves artifacts
11. ✅ Export artifacts → saves to S3
12. ✅ Await comms permission → workflow pauses
13. ✅ User approves comms
14. ✅ Comms executes → sends notifications
15. ✅ Await submission permission → workflow pauses
16. ✅ User approves submission
17. ✅ Submission executes → sends email
18. ✅ Complete → workflow finishes
19. ✅ Verify all DB records updated correctly

**Expected Duration**: 5-10 minutes (with agent LLM calls)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 7 agent nodes execute
- ✅ All 4 user interaction points handled
- ✅ All SSE events emitted correctly
- ✅ All DB records created/updated
- ✅ Conversation history complete
- ✅ Final status = COMPLETED
- ✅ Project progress = 100%

#### E2E Test: User Edits Path ✅

**Workflow with User Edits**:
1. Execute through artifact review
2. User provides content_edits
3. Verify content agent incorporates edits
4. Verify compliance/QA re-run
5. User approves
6. Complete workflow

**Success Criteria**:
- Edits properly applied to state
- Content agent uses edits
- Re-validation by compliance/QA
- Workflow completes

## Testing Tools

### Manual Testing Tools

1. **Postman/cURL**: Test FastAPI endpoints
   ```bash
   # Start workflow
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/invocations \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "project_id": "uuid-here",
       "user_id": "uuid-here",
       "session_id": "test-session-123",
       "start": true
     }'
   
   # Resume with feedback
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/invocations \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "project_id": "uuid-here",
       "user_id": "uuid-here",
       "session_id": "test-session-123",
       "start": false,
       "user_input": {
         "chat": "proceed"
       }
     }'
   ```

2. **SSE Client**: Test streaming
   ```bash
   curl -N http://localhost:8000/stream/test-session-123
   ```

3. **Database Inspection**: Verify records
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM workflow_executions WHERE session_id = 'test-session-123';
   SELECT * FROM agent_tasks WHERE workflow_execution_id = 'uuid';
   ```

### Automated Testing (Future)

1. **pytest**: Unit and integration tests
2. **pytest-asyncio**: Async test support
3. **httpx**: Async HTTP client for testing
4. **pytest-mock**: Mocking support

---

## Known Limitations & Trade-offs

### Current Implementation

1. **No Supervisor Agent Execution**: 
   - Supervisor is NOT invoked as an agent
   - Routing logic in conditional functions
   - Trade-off: Simpler but less flexible

2. **Simple Intent Analysis**:
   - Keyword-based classification
   - Could be improved with LLM
   - Trade-off: Fast but limited

3. **In-Memory Checkpointing**:
   - MemorySaver stores in memory
   - Lost on restart
   - Trade-off: Fast but not persistent
   - Production: Use PostgresCheckpointer

4. **No Unit Tests**:
   - Skipped for refactor speed
   - Recommend as follow-up
   - Trade-off: Faster refactor, lower confidence

### Production Recommendations

1. ✅ Replace MemorySaver with PostgresCheckpointer
2. ✅ Add comprehensive unit test suite
3. ✅ Improve intent analysis with LLM
4. ✅ Add rate limiting and authentication
5. ✅ Implement proper secrets management
6. ✅ Add performance monitoring
7. ✅ Implement circuit breakers for tools
