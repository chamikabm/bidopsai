### 9.2 Implement Role-Based Access Control ✅

#### Utilities Created

**Permission Utilities** (`src/lib/permissions.ts`)
- `hasPermission()` - Check if user has a specific permission
- `hasAnyPermission()` - Check if user has any of the specified permissions
- `hasAllPermissions()` - Check if user has all specified permissions
- `hasRole()` - Check if user has a specific role
- `hasAnyRole()` - Check if user has any of the specified roles
- `hasAllRoles()` - Check if user has all specified roles
- `getUserPermissions()` - Get aggregated permissions from all roles
- `canAccessRoute()` - Check route access based on permissions
- `filterMenuItems()` - Filter menu items based on user permissions

**Access Control Components**
- `ProtectedRoute` (`src/components/common/ProtectedRoute/`) - Route-level access control
- `PermissionGate` (`src/components/common/PermissionGate/`) - Component-level access control

#### Features Implemented
- ✅ Permission checking utilities for all user roles
- ✅ Route-level protection with ProtectedRoute component
- ✅ Component-level permission gates
- ✅ Menu filtering based on user roles (enhanced SidebarMenu)
- ✅ Role aggregation (users can have multiple roles)
- ✅ Permission aggregation from multiple roles
- ✅ Access denied fallback UI
- ✅ Redirect support for unauthorized access

#### Enhanced Components
- Updated `SidebarMenu.tsx` to use new permission utilities
- Integrated permission checking throughout the application

## Pages Created

### `/users` - User List Page
- Protected route requiring `canManageUsers` permission
- Full user list with search and filtering
- Create/Edit user dialogs
- Quick actions for each user

### `/users/[id]` - User Details Page
- Protected route requiring `canManageUsers` permission
- User profile information
- Roles and permissions display
- Project assignments
- Edit user functionality

## Role-Based Access Control Matrix

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to all features |
| **Bidder** | Full workflow, local KB management |
| **Drafter** | Limited to QA process, view KB |
| **KB-Admin** | Full KB management (global + local) |
| **KB-View** | Read-only KB access |

## Integration Points

### GraphQL Integration
- Uses existing queries: `GET_USERS`, `GET_USER`, `GET_CURRENT_USER`
- Uses existing mutations: `CREATE_USER`, `UPDATE_USER`, `DELETE_USER`, `ASSIGN_USER_ROLE`, `REMOVE_USER_ROLE`

### Authentication Integration
- Integrates with AWS Cognito via Amplify
- Uses `useAuth` hook for current user context
- Uses `usePermissions` hook for permission checking

### State Management
- TanStack Query for server state (user data)
- React Hook Form for form state
- Optimistic updates with cache invalidation

## Security Features

1. **Server-Side Operations**
   - User creation in Cognito handled server-side
   - Password validation and hashing via Cognito
   - Role assignment through secure GraphQL mutations

2. **Client-Side Protection**
   - Route-level access control
   - Component-level permission gates
   - Menu filtering based on roles
   - Action buttons hidden for unauthorized users

3. **Validation**
   - Email format validation
   - Password strength requirements (min 8 characters)
   - Password confirmation matching
   - Required field validation
