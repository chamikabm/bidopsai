## Next Steps
To use these components, you'll need to:

1. Create page routes:
   - `/projects` - List all projects (use ProjectList)
   - `/projects/new` - Create new project (use ProjectForm)
   - `/projects/[id]` - View project with workflow (use WorkflowProgress + AgentChatInterface)

2. Implement API routes:
   - `/api/workflow-agents/invocations` - POST endpoint for starting workflow
   - `/api/workflow-agents/stream` - SSE endpoint for real-time updates

3. Connect to backend:
   - Ensure GraphQL mutations are properly configured
   - Set up S3 bucket and presigned URL generation
   - Configure AgentCore integration

## Testing Recommendations
- Test file upload with various file types and sizes
- Test SSE connection and reconnection logic
- Test workflow progress updates
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test error handling scenarios
- Test keyboard shortcuts in chat input

## Status
✅ Task 5.1 Complete
✅ Task 5.2 Complete
