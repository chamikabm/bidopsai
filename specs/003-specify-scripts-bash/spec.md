# Feature Specification: AWS Strands Agent Build and Push to ECR Automation

**Feature Branch**: `003-specify-scripts-bash`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "aws strands agent for build and push to ECR. use context7"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Docker Image Build for Strands Agent (Priority: P1)

Developers need to build ARM64-compatible Docker images for Strands agents locally before pushing to ECR, ensuring the image is compatible with AWS Bedrock AgentCore runtime requirements.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step - without a properly built image, no deployment can occur. ARM64 architecture is required for Bedrock AgentCore runtimes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the build script with a valid Strands agent project directory and verifying the Docker image exists locally with correct platform (linux/arm64) and tag. Delivers a container image ready for ECR push.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Strands agent project with a Dockerfile, **When** the build script is executed, **Then** a Docker image is created with platform linux/arm64 and tagged with the repository name
2. **Given** an invalid Strands agent directory (missing Dockerfile), **When** the build script is executed, **Then** the script exits with a clear error message indicating the missing Dockerfile
3. **Given** Docker buildx is not configured, **When** the build script is executed, **Then** the script automatically creates and configures a buildx builder instance

---

### User Story 2 - Automated ECR Authentication and Push (Priority: P1)

Developers need to authenticate with ECR and push the built Docker image to the correct ECR repository without manually handling AWS credentials or ECR URIs.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical deployment step that enables the image to be available for Bedrock AgentCore runtime deployment. Without this, agents cannot be deployed to AWS.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the push script with valid AWS credentials and a pre-built Docker image, then verifying the image exists in ECR using AWS CLI. Delivers a deployable container image in ECR.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a built Docker image and valid AWS credentials, **When** the push script is executed, **Then** the script authenticates with ECR and successfully pushes the image with the correct tag
2. **Given** an ECR repository does not exist, **When** the push script is executed, **Then** the script creates the repository before pushing the image
3. **Given** invalid AWS credentials, **When** the push script is executed, **Then** the script fails with a clear authentication error message
4. **Given** the image already exists in ECR with the same tag, **When** the push script is executed with force flag, **Then** the image is overwritten with the new version

---

### User Story 3 - Combined Build and Push Workflow (Priority: P2)

Developers need a single command to build and push Strands agent images to ECR in one streamlined workflow for rapid iteration during development.

**Why this priority**: This enhances developer experience by reducing manual steps, but the individual build and push operations (P1) must work first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the combined script with a Strands agent project and verifying the image appears in ECR with the correct tag. Delivers end-to-end automation from source code to deployed ECR image.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Strands agent project and valid AWS credentials, **When** the combined script is executed, **Then** the Docker image is built and pushed to ECR in sequence
2. **Given** the build step fails, **When** the combined script is executed, **Then** the script halts before attempting the push and reports the build error
3. **Given** the push step fails, **When** the combined script is executed, **Then** the script reports the push error and indicates the local image is still available

---

### User Story 4 - Image Verification and Metadata Reporting (Priority: P3)

Developers need confirmation that the pushed image is available in ECR with correct metadata (architecture, size, digest) for troubleshooting and validation.

**Why this priority**: This provides visibility and confidence in the deployment but is not required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing an image to ECR and executing the verification command, which displays image metadata including digest, size, and platform. Delivers transparency into deployed artifacts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an image has been pushed to ECR, **When** the verification script is executed, **Then** the script displays image digest, size, platform architecture, and push timestamp
2. **Given** multiple image tags exist in the repository, **When** the verification script is executed, **Then** the script lists all tags sorted by push timestamp

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Docker buildx is not installed on the system? → Script should detect absence and provide installation instructions
- How does the system handle network interruptions during ECR push? → Script should detect push failures and allow retry without rebuilding
- What happens when AWS credentials expire mid-operation? → Script should validate credentials before starting build to prevent partial completion
- How does the system handle ECR repository tag limits (1000 tags per repository)? → Script should provide warning when approaching limit and suggest cleanup
- What happens when the built image exceeds ECR size limits (10GB)? → Script should check image size before push and fail early with size information
- How does the system handle multi-region ECR deployments? → Script should accept region parameter and validate region availability for Bedrock AgentCore

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST build Docker images with platform linux/arm64 to match AWS Bedrock AgentCore runtime requirements
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that a Dockerfile exists in the specified agent project directory before attempting build
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically configure Docker buildx if not already present for multi-platform builds
- **FR-004**: System MUST authenticate with AWS ECR using current AWS credentials from environment or AWS credential chain
- **FR-005**: System MUST create ECR repository if it does not exist before pushing images
- **FR-006**: System MUST tag Docker images with format `<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository>:<tag>`
- **FR-007**: System MUST push Docker images to the correct ECR repository in the specified AWS region
- **FR-008**: System MUST verify successful push by querying ECR for the pushed image digest
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages for common failure scenarios (missing Dockerfile, authentication failure, network errors)
- **FR-010**: System MUST accept configuration parameters via command-line arguments (repository name, image tag, AWS region)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support default values for optional parameters (tag defaults to 'latest', region defaults to AWS_REGION environment variable or 'us-east-1')
- **FR-012**: System MUST display build progress including layer processing and push status
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate AWS credentials before starting build to prevent partial completion
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow forced overwrite of existing ECR images with same tag via command-line flag
- **FR-015**: System MUST report image metadata after successful push including digest, size, and architecture

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Strands Agent Project**: Directory containing Dockerfile and agent source code, must conform to Strands agent structure with FastAPI/uvicorn entrypoint
- **Docker Image**: Built container artifact with platform linux/arm64, tagged with ECR repository URI and version tag
- **ECR Repository**: AWS Elastic Container Registry namespace for storing agent images, created if not exists, supports image scanning and immutable tags
- **Build Configuration**: Parameters including repository name (required), image tag (default: latest), AWS region (default: from AWS_REGION or us-east-1), and force overwrite flag (default: false)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can build and push a Strands agent Docker image to ECR in under 5 minutes for typical agent projects (excluding network transfer time)
- **SC-002**: Build scripts detect and report configuration errors (missing Dockerfile, invalid AWS credentials) within 10 seconds of execution without performing any build operations
- **SC-003**: 100% of pushed images are verifiable in ECR with correct architecture (linux/arm64) as confirmed by AWS CLI describe-images command
- **SC-004**: Scripts reduce manual steps for ECR deployment from 7 individual commands to 1 combined command, representing 85% reduction in manual operations
- **SC-005**: Error messages provide actionable next steps in 100% of common failure scenarios (authentication, network, validation errors)
