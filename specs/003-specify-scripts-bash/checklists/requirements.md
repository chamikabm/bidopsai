# Specification Quality Checklist: AWS Strands Agent Build and Push to ECR Automation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories from foundational (P1) to enhancement (P3)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage including credential expiry, network issues, and resource limits
- All functional requirements are testable and measurable
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (time to deploy, error detection speed, verification rate)
- No implementation details - focuses on WHAT/WHY rather than HOW
- Well-defined entities with clear boundaries

**Assumptions Documented**:
- AWS Bedrock AgentCore requires ARM64 architecture (established in existing specs/008)
- Default region is us-east-1 (matches existing infrastructure per AGENTS.md)
- ECR repository naming follows existing convention from StorageStack
- Docker and AWS CLI are available in developer environment (standard tooling)
