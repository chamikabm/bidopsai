# Specification Quality Checklist: Core GraphQL API for BidOps.AI Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-12  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY
- Business value and user workflows are clearly articulated
- User stories explain the value proposition for each feature area
- No technology-specific implementation details in requirements

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASS
- All 69 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- Each user story includes concrete acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases cover authentication failures, database connectivity, concurrent updates, and validation errors
- Success criteria include quantitative metrics (response times, uptime percentages, concurrent users)
- Assumptions clearly document external dependencies (Cognito, S3, PostgreSQL)

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASS
- 8 prioritized user stories cover the complete feature scope
- P1 stories (API Foundation, Project Lifecycle, Workflow Support) deliver core MVP functionality
- P2 stories (Artifacts, Knowledge Bases, Subscriptions) enhance the platform
- P3 stories (Notifications, Audit) provide additional value but aren't blockers
- Each story is independently testable and deliverable

### Success Criteria Analysis - ✅ PASS
- 24 success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- Performance criteria specify concrete thresholds (200ms queries, 500ms mutations, 99.9% uptime)
- Functionality criteria focus on user outcomes (create projects, manage workflows, receive updates)
- Security criteria address authentication and authorization without implementation details
- Development experience criteria ensure developer productivity

## Notes

✅ **Specification is ready for planning phase**

All checklist items pass. The specification provides:
- Clear business value through prioritized user stories
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all GraphQL operations
- Measurable success criteria for performance, reliability, and functionality
- Well-defined edge cases for error scenarios
- Explicit assumptions about external dependencies

**Recommendation**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation planning artifacts.
