## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Secure Access and Authentication (Priority: P1)

Users need to securely access the platform using multiple authentication methods including username/password and Google OAuth through AWS Cognito.

**Why this priority**: Without authentication, no user can access the platform. This is the foundational capability that enables all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to sign in with valid credentials, sign up as a new user, and authenticate via Google OAuth. Delivers secure access to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they click "Sign Up" and provide valid credentials (email, username, password), **Then** their account is created in Cognito and they are redirected to the dashboard
2. **Given** an existing user on the sign-in page, **When** they enter valid username and password, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the dashboard
3. **Given** a user on the sign-in page, **When** they click "Sign in with Google", **Then** they are redirected to Google OAuth flow and upon success, authenticated and redirected to the dashboard
4. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they attempt to access protected pages directly, **Then** they are redirected to the sign-in page
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click logout, **Then** their session is terminated and they are redirected to the sign-in page

---

### User Story 2 - Project Creation and Document Upload (Priority: P1)

Users need to create new bid projects by providing project details and uploading relevant documents (Word, Excel, PDF, Audio, Video) which are securely stored in S3.

**Why this priority**: Creating a project with documents is the primary entry point for the bid automation workflow. Without this, users cannot leverage any AI agent capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new project with various document types, verifying documents are uploaded to S3, and confirming project records are created in the database. Delivers the ability to initiate bid preparation work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user on the dashboard, **When** they navigate to "New Project" and fill in project name, description, deadline, **Then** a project form is displayed ready for document upload
2. **Given** a user on the new project form, **When** they drag and drop or select multiple documents (Word, Excel, PDF, Audio, Video), **Then** files are validated for type and size and added to the upload queue
3. **Given** a user with documents in the upload queue, **When** they click "Start", **Then** presigned S3 URLs are generated, documents are uploaded directly to S3, and project records are created in the database
4. **Given** a user during document upload, **When** upload progress occurs, **Then** real-time progress indicators show upload status for each file
5. **Given** a user after successful upload, **When** the project is created, **Then** the UI transitions to the agent workflow interface showing the progress bar and chat interface

---

### User Story 3 - Real-time Agent Workflow Visualization (Priority: P1)

Users need to see real-time progress of the AI agent workflow as documents are processed through multiple stages (Parser → Analysis → Content → Compliance → QA → Comms → Submission).

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - users need visibility into the AI-powered bid automation process. Without this, they can't understand what's happening or provide feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an agent workflow and observing real-time SSE updates in the UI, including progress bar animations, agent status changes, and chat messages. Delivers transparency into the AI automation process.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project with uploaded documents, **When** the agent workflow is triggered, **Then** the progress bar displays all 8 workflow steps with the first step (Parsing) animated as "in progress"
2. **Given** an active workflow, **When** agent SSE events are received, **Then** the chat interface displays agent messages with timestamps showing what's being processed
3. **Given** a workflow step completion, **When** an agent completes its task, **Then** the progress bar updates to mark that step as complete and animates the next step as "in progress"
4. **Given** a workflow waiting for user input, **When** an agent needs feedback, **Then** the chat interface enables the input field and prompts the user with specific questions
5. **Given** a workflow failure, **When** an agent task fails, **Then** the error is displayed in the chat interface with details and the workflow status is marked as "failed"

---

### User Story 4 - Artifact Review and Editing (Priority: P1)

Users need to review and edit AI-generated artifacts (documents, Q&A responses, spreadsheets) in interactive editors before approval.

**Why this priority**: Users must be able to verify and refine AI-generated content before submission. This ensures quality and allows human oversight of the automated process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking on generated artifacts, editing content in the appropriate editor (rich text for documents, Q&A format for questionnaires, table for spreadsheets), and saving changes. Delivers user control over AI-generated outputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** completed content generation, **When** artifacts are streamed from agents, **Then** clickable artifact tiles are displayed in the chat interface showing type, title, and preview
2. **Given** artifact tiles displayed, **When** a user clicks on a document artifact (worddoc/pdf category: document), **Then** a modal opens with a TipTap rich text editor pre-populated with the artifact content
3. **Given** an open artifact editor, **When** a user makes edits to the content, **Then** changes are saved to the Zustand client state (not yet sent to agents)
4. **Given** artifact tiles displayed, **When** a user clicks on a Q&A artifact (category: q_and_a), **Then** a modal opens with a custom Q&A editor showing questions, proposed answers, and past answers in editable sections
5. **Given** multiple edited artifacts, **When** a user types feedback in the chat and sends, **Then** all edited content is sent to the agent workflow along with the chat message

---

### User Story 5 - Dashboard Overview and Navigation (Priority: P2)

Users need a dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of key metrics (Submitted Bids, Won Bids, Total Value, Active Projects) and quick access to their assigned projects.

**Why this priority**: After authentication, users need to understand their current work status and navigate to active projects. This is the landing experience that sets context.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and viewing the dashboard with statistics tiles and project list. Delivers situational awareness and navigation capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** four stat cards display: Submitted Bids count, Won Bids count, Total Value amount, Active Projects count
2. **Given** a user on the dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** active/assigned projects are listed with project name, status, deadline, and progress percentage
3. **Given** a user with no projects, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** an empty state is shown with a button/link to create their first project
4. **Given** a user on the dashboard, **When** they click on a project card, **Then** they navigate to that project's detail page showing workflow progress
5. **Given** a user with assigned roles/permissions, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** only projects they have access to based on their role are displayed

---

### User Story 6 - Knowledge Base Management (Priority: P2)

Users need to create and manage knowledge bases (global or project-specific) by uploading documents that AI agents can reference during content generation.

**Why this priority**: Knowledge bases enable AI agents to access historical bid data, past Q&A responses, and company-specific information, improving the quality of generated content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new knowledge base, uploading documents, searching for documents, and associating the KB with projects. Delivers the ability to build institutional knowledge for AI agents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user with KB permissions, **When** they navigate to "Knowledge Bases", **Then** they see two sections: Global Knowledge Bases and Local Knowledge Bases displayed as tiles

3. **Given** a user creating a knowledge base, **When** they select "Local" scope, **Then** a project selector dropdown appears to associate the KB with a specific project
4. **Given** a user on the KB form, **When** they upload documents (Word, Excel, PDF, Audio, Video), **Then** files are validated, uploaded to S3, and indexed in the Bedrock Knowledge Base
5. **Given** a user viewing a knowledge base, **When** they access the KB detail page, **Then** all documents are listed with search capability to find specific documents

---

### User Story 7 - User Management and Role Assignment (Priority: P2)

Administrators need to create user accounts, assign roles (Admin, Drafter, Bidder, KB-Admin, KB-View), and manage user access to projects.

**Why this priority**: Role-based access control is essential for enterprise use, enabling proper delegation of responsibilities and security boundaries.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an Admin user creating new users, assigning roles, and verifying role-based visibility of features. Delivers access control and user administration capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an Admin user, **When** they navigate to "User Management", **Then** a list of all users is displayed with name, email, role, and quick action buttons
2. **Given** an Admin on the user list, **When** they click "Add User", **Then** a form appears to enter user details (email, username, first name, last name, profile image) and select roles
3. **Given** an Admin creating a user, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the user account is created in AWS Cognito and assigned the selected roles in the database
4. **Given** an Admin viewing a user's detail page, **When** they view the user profile, **Then** assigned projects are listed with the ability to add or remove project associations
5. **Given** a Drafter role user, **When** they access the application, **Then** they can view and work on projects up through the QA step but cannot access Comms or Submission agent steps

---

### User Story 8 - System Settings and Configuration (Priority: P3)

Users need to configure application settings including agent parameters (model, temperature), integrations (Slack), theme preferences, language, and data retention policies.

**Why this priority**: While important for customization and optimal operation, the application can function with default settings. This enhances user experience but isn't blocking for core workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing settings pages, modifying various configuration options, and verifying changes persist and affect application behavior. Delivers customization capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they navigate to Settings > Agent Configuration, **Then** a list of all 9 agents is displayed with editable fields for model name, temperature, max tokens, and system prompt
2. **Given** a user on Agent Configuration, **When** they modify agent parameters and save, **Then** changes are persisted to the database and affect future agent invocations
3. **Given** a user in Settings > Integrations, **When** they configure Slack integration with webhook URL and channel, **Then** the integration is saved and can be tested with a "Test Connection" button
4. **Given** a user in Settings > System, **When** they select a theme (Light, Dark, Deloitte, Futuristic), **Then** the UI immediately updates to reflect the selected theme and preference is saved
5. **Given** a user in Settings > System, **When** they change language (EN US, EN AU), **Then** UI text updates to the selected locale and preference persists across sessions

---

### User Story 9 - Infrastructure and Deployment Pipeline (Priority: P1)

DevOps engineers and developers need automated infrastructure provisioning, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines to deploy the application reliably across development, staging, and production environments.

**Why this priority**: Without proper infrastructure and deployment automation, the application cannot be deployed to AWS ECS or maintained effectively. This is foundational for operationalizing the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running CDK stack deployment for Cognito, building Docker images locally and in CI/CD, deploying to ECS via GitHub Actions, and executing Makefile commands. Delivers deployment automation and infrastructure as code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AWS credentials configured, **When** a developer runs the CDK deploy command, **Then** a Cognito User Pool is created with username/password and Google OAuth providers configured
2. **Given** the Dockerfile.dev exists, **When** a developer runs the local development Docker command, **Then** the application starts with hot-reload enabled and accessible on localhost
3. **Given** the Dockerfile exists, **When** CI/CD builds the production image, **Then** an optimized Next.js production image is created with all dependencies
4. **Given** code is pushed to the main branch, **When** GitHub Actions workflow triggers, **Then** Docker image is built, pushed to ECR, and deployed to ECS automatically
5. **Given** the Makefile exists, **When** a developer runs make commands, **Then** common operations (build, run, test, deploy) execute successfully with proper error handling

---

### User Story 10 - Project Collaboration and Notifications (Priority: P3)

Users need to be notified when project milestones are reached, artifacts are ready for review, or they are mentioned in project discussions.

**Why this priority**: Collaboration features improve team coordination but core workflows can operate without real-time notifications initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering various project events and verifying notifications appear in the UI and optionally via Slack/email. Delivers team awareness capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project with multiple members, **When** an agent workflow completes a major step, **Then** all project members receive a notification in the application
2. **Given** a user with unread notifications, **When** they view the top navigation bar, **Then** the notification icon displays an unread count badge
3. **Given** a user clicking the notification icon, **When** the notifications panel opens, **Then** recent notifications are listed with title, message, timestamp, and read/unread status
4. **Given** Slack integration configured, **When** the Comms Agent sends notifications, **Then** a Slack channel is created or used and notifications are posted with artifact links
5. **Given** a user mentioned in a project chat, **When** another user types @username, **Then** a notification is created for the mentioned user

- How does the system handle very large file uploads (video files, large PDFs)?
  - File size limits are enforced (e.g., 500MB per file), with chunked uploads for better reliability and progress tracking
  
- What happens when a user's session expires during an active workflow?
  - Users receive a notification that their session expired and are prompted to re-authenticate, with workflow state preserved when they return
  
- How does the system handle users with no assigned roles or permissions?
  - Users see a restricted view with a message to contact an administrator for role assignment
  
- What happens when Cognito authentication services are temporarily unavailable?
