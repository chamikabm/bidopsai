## Detailed Verification Results

### ✅ Database Schema Coverage
All 17 entities from `docs/database/bidopsai.mmd` are properly referenced:
- User, Role, Permission, UserRole
- Project, ProjectDocument, ProjectMember
- WorkflowExecution, AgentTask, AgentConfiguration
- Artifact, ArtifactVersion
- KnowledgeBase, KnowledgeBaseDocument, KnowledgeBasePermission
- Notification, Integration, SubmissionRecord, BidStatistics

### ✅ Folder Structure Alignment
Specification aligns with the complete folder structure defined in `docs/scratches/01-initial.md` (lines 174-524):
- All route groups defined: (auth), (main), api
- All page routes specified: dashboard, projects, knowledge-bases, users, settings
- Component hierarchy captured in functional requirements
- State management approach documented (TanStack Query + Zustand)

### ✅ Agent Flow Coverage
All workflow steps from `docs/architecture/agent-core/agent-flow-diagram.md` are captured:
- 8 workflow steps explicitly defined in FR-014

- User feedback loops covered in User Story 3 and 4

### ✅ User Roles & Permissions
All 5 user roles from `docs/scratches/01-initial.md` (lines 553-561) correctly specified:
- Admin (full access)
- Drafter (limited to up to QA step)
- Bidder (full agentic flow, local KB CRUD)
- KB-Admin (full KB access)
- KB-View (read-only KB access)

### ✅ SSE Events Coverage
All SSE event types from agent flow diagram are covered:
- workflow_created, parser_started, parser_completed, parser_failed
- analysis_started, analysis_completed, analysis_failed, analysis_restarted
- content_started, content_completed, content_failed
- compliance_started, compliance_completed, compliance_failed, returning_to_content
- qa_started, qa_completed, qa_failed
- artifacts_ready, awaiting_review, artifacts_exported
- comms_started, comms_completed, comms_failed, comms_permission
- submission_started, submission_completed, submission_failed, submission_permission
- email_draft, workflow_completed

### ✅ Artifact Types & Categories
Specification correctly defines artifact structure from `docs/scratches/01-initial.md` (lines 660-862):
- Types: worddoc, pdf, ppt, excel (FR-019)
- Categories: document, q_and_a, excel (FR-021)
- TipTap JSON format for documents (FR-020)
- Q&A format with proposed_answer and past_answers (FR-021)
- Versioning via ArtifactVersion entity

### ✅ GraphQL Schema Alignment
All major GraphQL operations from `docs/architecture/core-api/gql-schema.md` are referenced:
- Queries: projects, knowledgeBases, users, artifacts, workflowExecutions
- Mutations: createProject, updateProject, createKnowledgeBase, generatePresignedUrls
- Subscriptions: projectUpdated, workflowExecutionUpdated, notificationReceived
- Enums: ProjectStatus, WorkflowStatus, AgentTaskStatus, AgentType, ArtifactType, etc.

### ✅ Infrastructure Requirements
All deployment components are covered in User Story 9 and FR-058 through FR-070:
- CDK stack for Cognito User Pool with OAuth
- Dockerfile.dev with hot-reload
- Production Dockerfile for ECS
- Makefile with common targets
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ECR, ECS, CloudWatch integration
- Environment configurations
